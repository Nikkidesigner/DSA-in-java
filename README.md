Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, Heaps, Tries



1/ Stack
Stacks are a type of data structure that holds multiple items which are inserted or removed in a LIFO (Last-in, First-out) principle. You can implement a stack using an array and linked list, and each of these has different rules for inserting or removing elements from a stack. This part of the data structure module will give you an idea of stack implementation using an array and linked list.

2/ Queue
Queue data structure is used for storing and managing data in a particular order. You can insert or remove an element from a queue by following the FIFO (First-in, First-out) principle. These can be implemented using arrays, linked lists, and stacks. You will learn the process of queue implementation using different data structures in this module.

3/ Circular Queue
This abstract data type allows you to add an element at the end of a queue and remove an element from the beginning of the queue. You will learn more about circular queues and their implementation, along with the understanding of double-ended queues.

4/ Priority Queues
Priority queues are special queues in the data structure where there is a priority factor associated with each elementâ€™s insertion and deletion from the queue. It can be implemented in multiple data structures, including arrays, linked lists, heaps and binary search. This part of the module will cover the knowledge of Heap data structure and the implementation of priority queues through Heap and Linked Lists.

5/ Types of Linked List
Linked list data structures comprise nodes where each of which contains data and a reference link to the next node in the sequence. There are multiple types of Linked list operations that you will learn in this section, along with how to clone a linked list.

Insertion Operation
Deletion Operation
Search Operation
Sorting Operation
Reverse Operation
Cloning a Linked List

6/ Basic of Trees
Trees are hierarchical data structures that consist of multiple nodes and are connected by links. It stems from a single root node and is connected to other subtrees. You can learn how to visit from one node to another (tree traversals), measure the height and depth of the tree, and about Complete Binary Tree (CBT) and Full Binary Tree (FBT).

7/ Binary Search Trees (BST)
Binary Search Trees stores and organises data in a sorted way. These trees have two nodes that further break down into two and continue till you store all the data. This part of the module will teach you how to insert, delete, and search data in a BST and have hands-on practice with some problems on BST.

8/ Trie Data Structure
Trie (derived from retrieval) is a multiway tree data structure that can store strings over an alphabet and is mainly used for prefix-based searching. Besides learning operations on Trie, you will get knowledge of dictionaries, prefix matching, and bit manipulation.
